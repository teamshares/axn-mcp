# Changelog

## 0.1.1

- Migrated internal configuration off hand-rolled code onto the upstream `Axn::Configurable` DSL (added in axn PRO-2769). The public surface is unchanged: `Axn::MCP.config.mcp_text_content`, per-tool `mcp_text_content(...)` overrides, and `resolved_mcp_text_content` all behave as before.
- Requires an `axn` version that ships `Axn::Configurable`.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release
- `Axn::MCP::Tool` base class for building MCP tools with Axn
- Auto-generated JSON schemas from `expects`/`exposes` declarations
- Automatic `model:` field handling (exposes `_id` field to LLM)
- Auto-serialization of exposed values to JSON-safe structures
- Annotation shortcuts: `read_only!`, `destructive!`, `idempotent!`, `open_world!`, `closed_world!`
- Factory-style `Tool.define` for quick one-off tools
- Dual-use: returns `Axn::Result` for direct calls, `MCP::Tool::Response` when called via MCP server
- Typed array element schemas: `Array` fields with `of:` emit a machine-readable `items:` entry in JSON Schema rather than a bare `array` type — scalar types, `:boolean`/`:uuid` shorthands, `Data.define` structs (bare member names), and union types (`anyOf`) are all supported
- Structured field contracts via `shape:` block: annotate individual element/member types and validations inline; `required` is derived automatically from optional vs non-optional members; blocks recurse for nested objects
- When `of: <Data.define>` and a `shape:` block are combined, Data members provide the bare-name baseline and block-declared members overlay typed properties (enrich)
